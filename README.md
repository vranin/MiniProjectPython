## MiniProjectPython

#This is a Python-language based project which essentially functions as a simple arithmetic calculator.Based on the user input the function allows the user to do the following mathematical operations-addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and finding out the value of a number raised to the other.Here, the calculator takes two values.

#Following are the concepts that I have implemented to make the programme.
1.Print function- Used it to print a statement to the console and lets the programme with the user 
2.Comments - Have used the symbol '#' to write any comment that makes it easier for someone else to understand my program
3.Created two variables num1 and num2 that store the two values from the user
4.Input function- Used it to take values from the user and store within the two variables- num1 and num2
5.Strip method- Implemented the strip method with input function to remove any blank spaces
6.Try-except - Using try-except with float function so that programme can take float values as well
7.Created another variable named operator that stores the value of the operator chosen by the user provided
8.At the end I use if-elif control flow statements that work based on the user's input
9.Also I have used the concept of nested if-else statement in one of the sections ie the division part so the computer still keeps running even if the divisor is input as 0 by the user.

#Thank you
